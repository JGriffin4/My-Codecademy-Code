# My-Codecademy-Code

As a recent graduate in technical writing, I knew that I needed to begin networking and learning from those already in the field to get my first job.
During one of these meetings, I was told how beneficial knowledge of code could be. 
This inspired me to take steps towards learning my first language, Python. 
This repository holds examples from that process, demonstrating some of what I learned through Codecademy.
